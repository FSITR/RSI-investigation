# RSI-investigation
## Purpose
- To gain insight into the causes of repetative strain injury for computer uses.
- I am specifically interested in whether pain can be predicted with inputs such as typing speed, number and duration of breaks etc.

## Introduction and backround information
- I have, like many computer users, suffered from RSI in the past. After conducting lots of research I can conclude that whilst there are many hypothesised caueses of RSi<br>
there is no general consensus, and the causes of symptoms fluctate between individuals.
- I decided to investigate some of the theories, relating to computer usage ergonomics and rest, to understand if there are answers within data driven solutions.

## Problem statement
- Can we predict the presence, intesity and location of RSI based on keybaord usage?

## Data
- I have collected all of the data myself for this piece of work, there are two data sources:
  - Pain data (1 file): this is a spreadsheet which I manually populate based on a basic coded scoring system which I developed. This includes;
    - time of pain
    - location of pain (arm, wrist, finger, etc.).
    - intensity of pain (L,M,H).
    - type of pain (sharp, dull, burning etc.).
   - Key stroke data (700 files - condensed into one)
     - this is data collected using a program which I have written, this counts the number of key strokes every 3 seconds and creates a csv at the end of the day.
